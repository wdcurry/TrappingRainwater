# TrappingRainwater
A swift version of the Trapping Rainwater interview question with a graphical interface.

This was a simple project to help me explore using Neon (https://github.com/mamaral/Neon). Neon obviates so much headache
with autolayout.  The simple logic of the Trapping Rainwater interview question screamed out for a graphical interface to 
manifest the logic and allow those preparing for interviews to wrap their heads around a few approaches.

I do not profess to supply the most efficient answer, but this is one that works well from a logical perspective.
The secondary "sideways vector" approach was one i knew had to exist but was more etherial to produce, but just wanted to
manifest it.

I hope this simple repo helps a few logically think out the problem. Feedback is well, as i am sure there are many ways
to improve this solution.
